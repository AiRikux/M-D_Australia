Report about trends in Marriage and Divorce in Australia

I did an analysis about marriage and divorce trends in Australia 2014 to 2018

This project was done to complete an assignment for a subject in my first year in Monash University

Data are obtained from
* Australian Bureau of Statistics - https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3310.02018?OpenDocument
* OECD - http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm


The project was focused on answering questions such as
* How has marriage (divorce) rate changed over time?
* What are noticeable trends related to marriage in Australia? Eg: marriage celebrant, marital status, age group, ethnicity.
* How does marriage (divorce) rate differ by location (Australia and other countries) and time?
